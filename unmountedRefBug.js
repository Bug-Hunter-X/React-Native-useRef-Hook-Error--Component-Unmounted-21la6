This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted prematurely.  The `current` property of the ref might still be referencing the unmounted component, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. For example, if you try to access a property or method of the component via `ref.current` after it has been unmounted, you'll get an error because the component no longer exists in the DOM. This is especially common with timers or animations that continue after the component is unmounted.
